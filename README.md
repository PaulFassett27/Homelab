  Initial Setup and Operating System

  The first piece of hardware I acquired for my homelab was a refurbished Optiplex 5050 from a local electronics refurbusing store. I got a pretty good deal and it came with an i5-7700 and 16 gb of ram. They ship these refurbished computers with no operating system installed so my first order of business was to install my OS of choice. I took a while to research and look into what OS would fit my needs the best and also help me gain useful skills along the way. I deceided to download and install Rocky Linux. I chose this because it is a powerful OS that is caplable of running everything I need along with helping me prepare for the RHCSA certification.

  Raspberry Pi

  Right of the bat I set up a Pi Hole on my Raspberry Pi and configured it to be the main DNS server for my devices such as me and my wifes phones and our tv. I found that there was a few confgiurations that Pi Hole was lacking so I switched to Adguard as I feel as if it was more robust and allowed me to have more control over the DNS settings.
